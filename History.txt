# master

### Changed

* `require 'capybara/rails'` will automatically enable `:respect_data_method`
  on the RackTest driver, so the behavior matches Capybara 1.1.2 [Jo Liss]

### Fixed

* `has_text` (`has_content`) now accepts non-string arguments, like numbers.
  [Jo Liss]
* `has_text` and `text` now correctly normalize Unicode whitespace, such as
  `&nbsp;`. [Jo Liss]

# Version 2.0.0.beta2

### Changed

* `respect_data_method` default to `false` for the RackTest driver, which means
  that Capybara no longer picks up `:method => :post` et. al. from links in Rails
  by default. [Jonas Nicklas]
* `find` now raises an error if more than one element was found. Since `find` is
  used by most actions, like `click_link` under the surface, this means that all
  actions need to unambiguous in the future. [Jonas Nicklas]
* `Element#text` on RackTest now only returns visible text and normalizes
  (strips) whitespace, as with Selenium [Mark Dodwell, Jo Liss]
* `has_content?` now checks the text value returned by `Element#text`, as opposed to
  querying the DOM. Which means it does not match hidden text.
  [Ryan Montgomery, Mark Dodwell, Jo Liss]
* #394: `#body` now returns the unmodified source (like `#source`), not the current
  state of the DOM (like `#html`), by popular request [Jonas Nicklas]
* `Node#all` no longer returns an array, but rather an enumerable `Capybara::Result`
  [Jonas Nicklas]
* The arguments to `select` and `unselect` needs to be the exact text of an option
  in a select box, substrings are no longer allowed [Jonas Nicklas]
* The `options` option to `has_select?` must match the exact set of options. Use
  `with_options` for the old behaviour. [Gonzalo Rodriguez]
* The `selected` option to `has_select?` must match all selected options for multiple
  selects. [Gonzalo Rodriguez]
* Various internals for running driver specs, this should only affect driver authors
  [Jonas Nicklas]

### Removed

* No longer possible to specify `failure_message` for custom selectors. [Jonas Nicklas]
* #589: `Capybara.server_boot_timeout` has been removed in favor of a higher
  (60-second) hard-coded timeout [Jo Liss]
* `Capybara.prefer_visible_elements` has been removed, as it is no longer needed
  with the changed find semantics [Jonas Nicklas]
* `Node#wait_until` and `Session#wait_until` have been removed. See `Node#synchronize`
  for an alternative [Jonas Nicklas]
* `Capybara.timeout` has been removed [Jonas Nicklas]
* The `:resynchronize` option has been removed from the Selenium driver [Jonas Nicklas]
* The `rows` option to `has_table?` has been removed without replacement.
  [Jonas Nicklas]

### Fixed

* Nodes found via `all` are no longer reloaded. This fixes weird quirks where
  nodes would seemingly randomly replace themselves with other nodes [Jonas Nicklas]
* Session is only reset if it has been modified, dramatically improves performance if
  only part of the test suite runs Capybara. [Jonas Nicklas]
* Test suite now passes on Ruby 1.8 [Jo Liss]
* #565: `require 'capybara/dsl'` is no longer necessary [Jo Liss]
* `Rack::Test` now respects ports when changing hosts [Jo Liss]
* #603: `Rack::Test` now preserves the original referer URL when following a
  redirect [Rob van Dijk]
* Rack::Test now does not send a referer when calling `visit` multiple times
  [Jo Liss]
* Exceptions during server boot now propagate to main thread [James Tucker]
* RSpec integration now cleans up before the test instead of after [Darwin]
* If `respect_data_method` is true, the data-method attribute can be capitalized
  [Marco Antonio]
* Rack app boot timing out raises an error as opposed to just logging to STDOUT
  [Adrian Irving-Beer]
* `#source` returns an empty string instead of nil if no pages have been visited
  [Jonas Nicklas]
* Ignore first leading newline in textareas in RackTest [Vitalii Khustochka]
* `within_frame` returns the value of the given block [Alistair Hutchison]
* Running `Node.set` on text fields will not trigger more than one change event
  [Andrew Kasper]
* Throw an error when an option is given to a finder method, like `all` or
  `has_selector?` which Capybara doesn't understand [Jonas Nicklas]
* Two references to the node now register as equal when comparing them with `==`
  [Jonas Nicklas]

### Added

* Much improved error message [Jonas Nicklas]
* Errors from inside the session for apps running in a server are raised when
  session is reset [James Tucker, Jonas Nicklas]
* A ton of new selectors built in out of the box, like `field`, `link`, `button`,
  etc... [Adam McCrea, Jonas Nicklas]
* `has_text?` has been added as an alias for `has_content?` [Jonas Nicklas]
* Add `Capybara.server_host` option (default: 127.0.0.1) [David Balatero]
* Add `:type` option for `page.has_field?` [Gonzalo Rodríguez]
* Custom matchers can now be specified in CSS in addition to XPath [Jonas Nicklas]
* `Node#synchronize` method to rerun a block of code if certain errors are raised
  [Jonas Nicklas]
* `Capybara.always_include_port` config option always includes the server port in
  URLs when using `visit`. Facilitates testing different domain names`. [Douwe Maan]
* Redirect limit for RackTest driver is configurable [Josh Lane]
* Server port can be manually specified during initialization of server.
  [Jonas Nicklas, John Wilger]
* `has_content?` and `has_text?` can be given a regular expression [Vasiliy Ermolovich]

# Version 0.3.7

Release date: 2010-04-09

This is a drop in compatible maintainance release. It's mostly
important for driver authors.

### Added

* RackTest scans for data-method which rails3 uses to change the request method

### Fixed

* Don't hang when starting server on Windoze

### Changed

* The driver and session specs are now located inside lib! Driver authors can simply require them.

# Version 0.3.6

Release date: 2010-03-22

This is a maintainance release with minor bug fixes, should be
drop in compatible.

### Added

* It's now possible to load in external drivers

### Fixed

* has_content? ignores whitespace
* Trigger events when choosing radios and checking checkboxes under Selenium
* Make Capybara.app totally optional when running without server
* Changed fallback host so it matches the one set up by Rails' integration tests

# Version 0.3.5

Release date: 2010-02-26

This is a mostly backwards compatible release, it does break
the API in some minor places, which should hopefully not affect
too many users, please read the release notes carefully!

### Breaking

* Relative searching in a node (e.g. find('//p').all('//a')) will now follow XPath standard
  this means that if you want to find descendant nodes only, you'll need to prefix a dot!
* `visit` now accepts fully qualified URLs for drivers that support it.
* Capybara will always try to run a rack server, unless you set Capybara.run_sever = false

### Changed

* thin is preferred over mongrel and webrick, since it is Ruby 1.9 compatible
* click_button and click will find <input type="button">, clicking them does nothing in RackTest

### Added

* Much improved error messages in a multitude of places
* More semantic page querying with has_link?, has_button?, etc...
* Option to ignore hidden elements when querying and interacting with the page
* Support for multiple selects

### Fixed

* find_by_id is no longer broken
* clicking links where the image's alt attribute contains the text is now possible
* within_fieldset and within_table work when the default selector is CSS
* boolean attributes work the same across drivers (return true/false)
