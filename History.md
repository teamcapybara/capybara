  under RackTest [Jonas Nicklas]

# Version 2.1.0

Release date: 2013-04-09

### Changed

* Hard version requirement on Ruby >= 1.9.3. Capybara will no longer install
  on 1.8.7. [Felix SchÃ¤fer]
* Capybara no longer depends on the `selenium-webdriver` gem. Add it to
  your Gemfile if you wish to use the Selenium driver. [Jonas Nicklas]
* `Capybara.ignore_hidden_elements` defaults to `true`. [Jonas Nicklas]
* In case of multiple matches `smart` matching is used by default. Set
  `Capybara.match = :one` to revert to old behaviour. [Jonas Nicklas].
* Options in select boxes use smart matching and no longer need to match
  exactly. Set `Capybara.exact_options = false` to revert to old behaviour.
  [Jonas Nicklas].
* Visibility of text depends on `Capybara.ignore_hidden_elements` instead of
  always returning only visible text. Set `Capybara.visible_text_only = true`
  to revert to old behaviour. [Jonas Nicklas]
* Cucumber cleans up session after scenario instead. This is consistent with
  RSpec and makes more sense, since we raise server errors in `reset!`.
  [Jonas Nicklas]

### Added

* All actions (`click_link`, `fill_in`, etc...) and finders now take an options
  hash, which is passed through to `find`. [Jonas Nicklas]
* CSS selectors are sent straight through to driver instead of being converted
  to XPath first. Enables the use of some pseudo selectors, such as `invalid`
  in some drivers. [Thomas Walpole]
* `Capybara.asset_host` option, which inserts a `base` tag into the page on
  `save_and_open_page`, eases debugging with the Rails asset pipeline.
  [Steve Hull]
* `exact` option, can specify whether to match substrings or entire text.
  [Jonas Nicklas]
* `match` option, can specify behaviour in case of multiple matches.
  [Jonas Nicklas]
* `wait` option, can specify how long to wait for a given action/finder.
  [Jonas Nicklas]
* Config option which disables bubbling of errors raised inside server.
  [Jonas Nicklas]
* `text` now takes a parameter which makes it possible to return either all
  text or only visible text. The default depends on
  `Capybara.ignore_hidden_elements`. `Capybara.visible_text_only` option is
  available for compatibility. [Jonas Nicklas]
* `has_content?` and `has_text?` now take the same count options as `has_selector?`
  [Andrey Botalov]
* `current_scope` is now public API, returns the current element when `within`
  is used. [Martijn Walraven]
* `find("input").disabled?` returns true if a node is disabled. [Ben Lovell]
* Find disabled fields and buttons with `:disabled => false`. [Jonas Nicklas]
* `find("input").hover` moves the mouse to the element in supported drivers.
  [Thomas Walpole]
* RackTest driver now support `form` attribute on form elements.
  [Thomas Walpole]
* `page.title` returns the page title. [Terry Progetto]
* `has_title?` matcher to assert on page title. [Jonas Nicklas]
* The gem is now signed with a certicficate. The public key is available in the
  repo. [Jonas Nicklas]
* `:select` and `:textarea` are valid options for the `:type` filter on `find_field`
  and `has_field?`. [Yann Plancqueel]

### Fixed

* Fixed race conditions when synchronizing across multiple nodes [Jonas Nicklas]
* Fixed race conditions in deeply nested selectors [Jonas Nicklas]
* Fix issue with `within_frame`, where selecting multiple nested frames didn't
  work as intended. [Thomas Walpole]

* Rescue weird exceptions when booting server [John Wilger]
* Non strings are now properly cast when using the maxlength attribute [Jonas Nicklas]

# Version 2.0.3

Release date: 2013-03-26

  a Gem::Version [Jonas Nicklas]
* Use posix character class for whitespace replace, solves various encoding
  problems on Ruby 2.0.0 and JRuby. [Ben Cates]

# Version 2.0.2

Release date: 2012-12-31

### Changed

* Capybara no longer uses thin as a server if it is available, due to thread
  safety issues. Now Capybara always defaults to WEBrick. [Jonas Nicklas]

### Fixed

* Suppress several warnings [Kouhei Sutou]
* Fix default host becoming nil [Brian Cardarella]
* Fix regression in 2.0.1 which caused node comparisons with non node objects
  to throw an exception [Kouhei Sotou]

* Encoding error under JRuby [Piotr Krawiec]
* Ruby 2 encoding fix [Murahashi Sanemat Kenichi]
* Catch correct exception on server timeout [Jonathan del Strother]

# Version 2.0.1

Release date: 2012-12-21

### Changed

* Move the RackTest driver override with the `:respect_data_method` option
  enabled from capybara/rspec to capybara/rails, so that it is enabled in
  Rails projects that don't use RSpec. [Carlos Antonio da Silva]
* `source` is now an alias for `html`. RackTest no longer returns modifications
  to `html`. This basically codifies the behaviour which we've had for a while
  anyway, and should have minimal impact for end users. For driver authors, it
  means that they only have to implement `html`, and not `source`. [Jonas
  Nicklas]

### Fixed

* Visiting relative URLs when `app_host` is set and no server is running works
  as expected. [Jonas Nicklas]
* `fill_in` works properly under Selenium again when the caret is not at the
  end of the field before the method is called. [Douwe Maan, Jonas Nicklas, Jari
  Bakken]
* `attach_file` can once again be given a Pathname [Jake Goulding]

# Version 2.0.0

Release date: 2012-11-05

### Changed

* Dropped official support for Ruby 1.8.x. [Jonas Nicklas]
* `respect_data_method` default to `false` for the RackTest driver in non-rails
  applications. That means that Capybara no longer picks up `data-method="post"`
  et. al. from links by default when you haven't required capybara/rails
  [Jonas Nicklas]
* `find` now raises an error if more than one element was found. Since `find` is
  used by most actions, like `click_link` under the surface, this means that all
  actions need to unambiguous in the future. [Jonas Nicklas]
* All methods which find or manipulate fields or buttons now ignore them when
  they are disabled. [Jonas Nicklas]
* Can no longer find elements by id via `find(:foo)`, use `find("#foo")` or
  `find_by_id("foo")` instead. [Jonas Nicklas]
* `Element#text` on RackTest now only returns visible text and normalizes
  (strips) whitespace, as with Selenium [Mark Dodwell, Jo Liss]
* `has_content?` now checks the text value returned by `Element#text`, as opposed to
  querying the DOM. Which means it does not match hidden text.
  [Ryan Montgomery, Mark Dodwell, Jo Liss]
* #394: `#body` now returns the unmodified source (like `#source`), not the current
  state of the DOM (like `#html`), by popular request [Jonas Nicklas]
* `Node#all` no longer returns an array, but rather an enumerable `Capybara::Result`
  [Jonas Nicklas]
* The arguments to `select` and `unselect` needs to be the exact text of an option
  in a select box, substrings are no longer allowed [Jonas Nicklas]
* The `options` option to `has_select?` must match the exact set of options. Use
  `with_options` for the old behaviour. [Gonzalo Rodriguez]
* The `selected` option to `has_select?` must match all selected options for multiple
  selects. [Gonzalo Rodriguez]
* Various internals for running driver specs, this should only affect driver authors
  [Jonas Nicklas]
* Rename `Driver#body` to `Driver#html` (relevant only for driver authors) [Jo
  Liss]

### Removed

* No longer possible to specify `failure_message` for custom selectors. [Jonas Nicklas]
* #589: `Capybara.server_boot_timeout` has been removed in favor of a higher
  (60-second) hard-coded timeout [Jo Liss]
* `Capybara.prefer_visible_elements` has been removed, as it is no longer needed
  with the changed find semantics [Jonas Nicklas]
* `Node#wait_until` and `Session#wait_until` have been removed. See `Node#synchronize`
  for an alternative [Jonas Nicklas]
* `Capybara.timeout` has been removed [Jonas Nicklas]
* The `:resynchronize` option has been removed from the Selenium driver [Jonas Nicklas]
* The `rows` option to `has_table?` has been removed without replacement.
  [Jonas Nicklas]

### Added

* Much improved error message [Jonas Nicklas]

  `&nbsp;`. [Jo Liss]
* RackTest allows protocol relative URLs [Jonas Nicklas]

  as expected. [Jonas Nicklas]
* `:count => 0` now works as expected [Jarl Friis]
* Fixed race conditions on negative assertions when removing nodes [Jonas Nicklas]

# Version 1.1.4

Release date: 2012-11-28

### Fixed

* Fix more race conditions on negative assertions. [Jonas Nicklas]

# Version 1.1.3

Release date: 2012-10-30

### Fixed:

* RackTest driver ignores leading newline in textareas, this is consistent with
  the spec and how browsers behave. [Vitalii Khustochka]
* Nodes found via `all` and `first` are never reloaded. This fixes issues where
  a node would sometimes magically turn into a completely different node.
  [Jonas Nicklas]
* Fix race conditions on negative assertions. This fixes issues where removing
  an element and asserting on its non existence could cause
  StaleElementReferenceError and similar to be thrown. [Jonas Nicklas]
* Options are no longer lost when reloading elements. This fixes issues where
  reloading an element would cause a non-matching element to be found, because
  options to `find` were ignored. [Jonas Nicklas]

  only for the context node. See this post for details: http://groups.google.com/group/ruby-capybara/browse_thread/thread/b129067979df21b3
* within now executes within the first found instance of the selector, not in all of them
* find now waits for AJAX requests and raises an exception when the element is not found (same as locate used to do)

# Version 0.3.7

Release date: 2010-04-09

This is a drop in compatible maintenance release. It's mostly
important for driver authors.

### Added

* RackTest scans for data-method which rails3 uses to change the request method

### Fixed

* Don't hang when starting server on Windoze

### Changed

* The driver and session specs are now located inside lib! Driver authors can simply require them.

# Version 0.3.6

Release date: 2010-03-22

This is a maintenance release with minor bug fixes, should be
drop in compatible.

### Added

* It's now possible to load in external drivers

### Fixed

* has_content? ignores whitespace
* Trigger events when choosing radios and checking checkboxes under Selenium
* Make Capybara.app totally optional when running without server
* Changed fallback host so it matches the one set up by Rails' integration tests

# Version 0.3.5

Release date: 2010-02-26

This is a mostly backwards compatible release, it does break
the API in some minor places, which should hopefully not affect
too many users, please read the release notes carefully!

### Breaking

* Relative searching in a node (e.g. find('//p').all('//a')) will now follow XPath standard
  this means that if you want to find descendant nodes only, you'll need to prefix a dot!
* `visit` now accepts fully qualified URLs for drivers that support it.
* Capybara will always try to run a rack server, unless you set Capybara.run_sever = false

### Changed

* thin is preferred over mongrel and webrick, since it is Ruby 1.9 compatible
* click_button and click will find <input type="button">, clicking them does nothing in RackTest

### Added

* Much improved error messages in a multitude of places
* More semantic page querying with has_link?, has_button?, etc...
* Option to ignore hidden elements when querying and interacting with the page
* Support for multiple selects

### Fixed

* find_by_id is no longer broken
* clicking links where the image's alt attribute contains the text is now possible
* within_fieldset and within_table work when the default selector is CSS
* boolean attributes work the same across drivers (return true/false)
