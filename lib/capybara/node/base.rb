module Capybara
  module Node

    ##
    #
    # A {Capybara::Node::Base} represents either an element on a page through the subclass
    # {Capybara::Node::Element} or a document through {Capybara::Node::Document}.
    #
    # Both types of Node share the same methods, used for interacting with the
    # elements on the page. These methods are divided into three categories,
    # finders, actions and matchers. These are found in the modules
    # {Capybara::Node::Finders}, {Capybara::Node::Actions} and {Capybara::Node::Matchers}
    # respectively.
    #
    # A {Capybara::Session} exposes all methods from {Capybara::Node::Document} directly:
    #
    #     session = Capybara::Session.new(:rack_test, my_app)
    #     session.visit('/')
    #     session.fill_in('Foo', :with => 'Bar')    # from Capybara::Node::Actions
    #     bar = session.find('#bar')                # from Capybara::Node::Finders
    #     bar.select('Baz', :from => 'Quox')        # from Capybara::Node::Actions
    #     session.has_css?('#foobar')               # from Capybara::Node::Matchers
    #

      #
      # This method is Capybara's primary defence against asynchronicity
      # problems. It works by attempting to run a given block of code until it
      # succeeds. The exact behaviour of this method depends on a number of
      # factors. Basically there are certain exceptions which, when raised
      # from the block, instead of bubbling up, are caught, and the block is
      # re-run.
      #
      # Certain drivers, such as RackTest, have no support for asynchronous
      # processes, these drivers run the block, and any error raised bubbles up
      # immediately. This allows faster turn around in the case where an
      # expectation fails.
      #
      # Only exceptions that are {Capybara::ElementNotFound} or any subclass
      # thereof cause the block to be rerun. Drivers may specify additional
      # exceptions which also cause reruns. This usually occurs when a node is
      # manipulated which no longer exists on the page. For example, the
      # Selenium driver specifies
      # `Selenium::WebDriver::Error::ObsoleteElementError`.
      #
      # As long as any of these exceptions are thrown, the block is re-run,
      # until a certain amount of time passes. The amount of time defaults to
      # {Capybara.default_max_wait_time} and can be overridden through the `seconds`
      # argument. This time is compared with the system time to see how much
      # time has passed. On rubies/platforms which don't support access to a monotonic process clock
      # if the return value of `Time.now` is stubbed out, Capybara will raise `Capybara::FrozenInTime`.
      #
      # @param  [Integer] seconds         Number of seconds to retry this block
      # @param options [Hash]
      # @option options [Array<Exception>] :errors (driver.invalid_element_errors +
      #   [Capybara::ElementNotFound]) exception types that cause the block to be rerun
      # @return [Object]                  The result of the given block
      # @raise  [Capybara::FrozenInTime]  If the return value of `Time.now` appears stuck
